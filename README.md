# ct-image-preprocessing-pipeline

A collection of Python scripts I made for preprocessing lung CT images and segmentations utilizing SimpleITK and PyDicom. Eventually, the pipeline will be applied to analyze images from lung cancer patients in Nigeria. I validated the image processing pipeline on NSCLC Radiogenomics dataset.
